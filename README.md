- Welcome to my Calculator App repository! This repository contains the code for a fully functional calculator application .

## Features and tech stack used 
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear and user-friendly interface

## Mozilla Rhino
-Mozilla Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. 
- It is used in this app to evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user. 
- This allows for a flexible and robust calculation engine.
