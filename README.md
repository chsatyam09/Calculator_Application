# Calculator App
- Welcome to my Calculator App repository! This repository contains the code for a fully functional calculator application.

## Features and tech stack used 
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear and user-friendly interface
- Responsive UI design with Jetpack Compose
- Efficient calculation engine using Mozilla Rhino
- State management to store and reflect the latest  changes on the screen
- live data to show sudden changes 
- view model for handling data during configuration changes like screen rotations.

## Mozilla Rhino
-Mozilla Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. 
- It is used in this app to evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user. 
- This allows for a flexible and robust calculation engine.

## Usage
- Launch the app on your device.
- Use the on-screen buttons to perform calculations.
- The display will show the current input and results in real-time, thanks to LiveData.
